<p><br>My rock, my lock buddy, my part-time therapist, my critic, and my go-to person. You are my favorite hugger and my favorite person. Most importantly - you are my best friend in the entire world.</p>
  <p><br>
  Over the last one year, we have grown together. We have cried together, laughed together, and survived together. We have binged watched our life like small movie clips and have lived it for hours, gone on many many impromptu and unplanned dates, and just sat together in silence without getting bored for a second. I can talk to you all day and still find you fascinating. You’ve held my hand through the roughest moments of my life, but also through the scariest parts.</p>
  <p><br>This Saturday is one amazing year with you... The best one year of my life. Through this year together, you didn’t see my stress and deep thoughts as a fault, but rather as a challenge that you were more than willing to help me overcome. You have encouraged me, supported me, and believed in me when I felt like quitting at once even on myself. You've held me close during my breakdowns and laughed with me during our small fights. You’ve made me a stronger person and helped me convert my potential to true success. You've shown me that my character is what makes me “me”.</p>
  <p><br>You've helped me overcome challenges I thought would haunt me for eternity. You have shown me my worth and my value. You have loved me unconditionally for nearly 31622400 seconds, and that is the best gift I could have ever received.
  On this occasion, I want you to know how truly grateful I am to have you as my best friend, girlfriend, and soulmate. When I didn’t see myself as perfect, you’ve always been there to remind me that you think I'm perfect despite my flaws. You value who I truly am, no matter my past. You’ve accepted my imperfections and made me realize that they make me, me. Because of you, I know that no matter what life throws at me, I will always have an amazing support system right behind me to help me see through it.</p>
  <p><br>
  Because of you, I am this different personality I am today. Because of you, I have a best friend for life. I can't explain in words alone how you have impacted my life. You have touched my heart in a way no one else has ever tried. You have the kindest soul and the sweetest heart. I don’t know a single person who doesn’t like you. You are gentle, kind, humble and forgiving. You are an incredible person and your thoughts speak of your character and beautiful, pure mind. You see the goodness in humanity, even when it is hard to find. And the best part about you is you stay humble in spite of all these amazing qualities.</p>
  <p><br>I hope that someday your incredible soul will somehow rub off on me, and that I can be half the person you are. I love you more than words and am so happy that you made your way into my messy life and decided to stay. Through all the ups and downs, you have been the most amazing girlfriend and I am so very grateful that our incomparable bond flourishes and grows stronger each day. I know we will have that young love even when we are old. Here's to many more amazing years, laughs and amazing memories together. Thank you for being you.</p>
  <p><br>
  How one whole year has come and gone is absolutely beyond me. Time speeds around us so quickly; in the blink of an eye I went from me sitting with you in office every single day to me departing for progressing in my professional space, to me wanting to grip your hand for life, to this moment. It seems like 12 months have zoomed by in half the time, but it seems as if this has been my reality for so much longer. I can hardly remember what it’s like to not have you in my life. It is as if we two have been dating for years and years.</p>
  <p><br>
  There is so much that I want to say, but I have no idea how to categorize it and shorten it into something that would encompass ongoing volumes of what I feel for you. So much has happened in just this one year, but having the constant comfort of you by my side has made me feel like I can do anything. I have more hope and expectations for myself now than ever before. I have always wanted to pave for myself the best life possible, but I am so humbled to have you here—that having you here has made me see beyond myself. My goals are now yours, and your goals are now mine, and I am not ashamed of saying that I would prefer to build a life with you than to try to strive for greatness on my own. I see us as a power couple. I see us as the couple that everyone wants to be. I see us spending our lives pushing each other further, neither of us satisfied until the other is ahead.</p>
  <p><br>I think many people don't understand what real romance is. Anyone can buy flowers, candy and jewelry, but you have taught me that the truly romantic things in life are those little things you do every day to show you care and that you are thinking of me. It is going out of your way to make me happy; the way you hold my hand when you know I'm scared, the random text messages in the middle of the day, just to say, "I love you," or "I miss you." Romance is putting your favorite thing on pause so I can tell you about my day and laughing at my jokes—even the really lame ones. It is about smiling by just the thought of you and of kissing in the rain. Romance isn't about buying, it's about giving. True romance is in the gestures.</p>
  <p><br>Though I knew, I hardly even realized that I’ve been preparing myself for this. Every lesson I’ve learned, and every day dream I’ve had of you before I even knew who you were, has brought me to this moment where I can hardly keep my eyes dry long enough to get to the next sentence. Being in love and being loved feels so good. I wish everyone in the world could experience half, even a quarter of our love—the world would definitely be a much better place.
  I have received more love, caring and consideration from you in 12 months than I have from most people that I’ve known my entire life. Loving you is being 10 years old again, scaling a tree with my eyes bright and skyward, wanting only to get higher and higher, without a thought of how I would get back down. They say that you should treat others how you wish to be treated, and this is so true in that the very love you have given me is what I have used to love you in return. Your love—intense, yet playful, innocent and pure—fills me with peace, contentment and tranquility. It is always just enough. I can only hope that the love I have for you can give the love that you have given me a smidgen of justice. I will spend the rest of my life trying to make sure that it does.</p>
  <p><br>You are the finest, loveliest, tenderest and most beautiful person I have ever known—and even that is an understatement.</p>
  <p><br>Thank you for believing in me</p>
  <p><br>Thank you for saying the second YES</p>
  <p><br>Thank you for following my instincts despite the rough start</p>
  <p><br>I will always be grateful of you for giving me the chance.</p>
  <p><br>And finally I will say thanks for helping me become the person I am today.</p>
  <p><br>Yours only!</p>
  <p><br>Nirbhay Pherwani</p>
